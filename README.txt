Instructions:

Use a java compiler or IDE. I wrote this program in JetBrains IntelliJ IDE so if you have that I recommend using that.

This program using Jsoup to work. You will need to make sure you have the Jsoup library installed.

Simply click run to start the crawler.

If you want to change the URL that is being crawled, change the argument of
the method "crawl" in the main method to whatever URL you want. I have left it on the URL I was testing it with.

It will generate a file called "RESULTS.TXT" once you press the stop button.

The program will run for a long time since there are a lot of sites that are crawled. Press the stop button at any time
to look at the results at the time of stopping. The longer you let the program run, the longer and deeper it will crawl.

I recommend letting it run for about 10 or seconds before stopping to generate a decent amount of URLs.
